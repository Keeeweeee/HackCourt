## 🧠 What is HackCourt?

HackCourt is a **technical decision courtroom**.

Instead of teams arguing endlessly over stacks, frameworks, or architecture, HackCourt:
- hears both sides,
- applies judicial philosophy,
- evaluates evidence,
- and delivers a **final ruling**.

No vibes. No opinions. Just structured verdicts.

---

## ⚖️ Modes of Operation

### 🔹 Compare Mode
Present two competing technical approaches.

HackCourt delivers:
- A clear winner
- Confidence level
- **Exactly 3 evidence-backed trade-offs**
- Judicial warnings when risk is involved

Perfect for:
- Framework disputes
- Architecture decisions
- “This vs That” debates

---

### 🔹 Advisory Mode
Ask the court for technical counsel.

HackCourt delivers:
- A recommended stack
- Justification
- **3 supporting trade-offs**
- Explicitly rejected alternatives

Perfect for:
- Early-stage planning
- Uncertain teams
- Time-constrained hackathons

---

## 👩‍⚖️ Judicial Philosophy

HackCourt simulates *real judicial disagreement*.

### Hon. Justice Reliability
- Prefers proven, stable technology
- Penalizes novelty and complexity
- Optimized for risk minimization

### Hon. Justice Innovation
- Prefers modern tooling and demo impact
- Accepts calculated risk
- Optimized for presentation and differentiation

Same case. Different judge. Different ruling.  
By design.

## 🤖 AI Architecture (Disciplined by Law)

HackCourt is **AI-first but not AI-dependent**.

```bash
Groq AI
↓
Strict Validation
↓
Normalization
↓
Deterministic Fallback
```

If AI output violates contract rules, the system **automatically rejects it** and falls back to deterministic logic.

No broken UI. No hallucinated data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **AI:** Groq API  
- **Architecture:** Frontend-only, zero backend  
- **Safety:** Deterministic fallback engines

## 🚀 Why HackCourt?

Hackathons don’t fail because of bad ideas.  
They fail because teams can’t agree.

HackCourt:
- Saves time
- Forces clarity
- Makes trade-offs explicit
- Lets teams build instead of debate
